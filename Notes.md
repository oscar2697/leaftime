# ScrollView vs FlatList

## Use FlatList when:

— Performance is critical: FlatList only renders items currently visible on screen, saving memoryand improving performance.
— Long lists of data: When rendering potentially large sets of data (feeds, search results, message lists).
— Unknown content length: When you don't know in advance how many items you'll need to display.
— Same kind of content: When displaying many items with the same structure.

## Use ScrollView when:

— All content fits in memory: When you' re displaying a small, fixed amount of content that won't cause performance issues.
— Static content: For screens with predetermined, limited content like forms, profile pages, or detail views.
— Mixed content types: When you need to display different UI components in a specific layout that doesn't follow a list pattern.
— Horizontal carousel—like elements: Small horizontal scrolling components like image carousels with limited items.

# Pressable vs TouchableOpacity

## Use Pressable when:

— More customization is needed: Pressable offers more customization options for different states (pressed, hove red, focused) .
- Complex interaction states: When you need to handle multiple interaction states with fine—grained control.
— Future—proofing: Pressable is newer and designed to eventual ly replace the Touchable components.
— Platform—specific behavior: When you want to customize behavior across different platforms.
— Nested press handlers: When you need to handle nested interactive elements.

## Use TouchableOpacity when:

— Simple fade effect: When you just need a simple opacity change on press-
— Backwards compatibility: When working with older codebases that already use TouchableOpacity.
— Simpler API: When you prefer a more straightforward API with fewer options to configure.
— Specific opacity animations: When you need precise control over the opacity value on press.
— Legacy support: For maintaining consistency with existing components.

# Expo Image vs React Native Image

## Use Expo Image when:

— Performance: Expo Image uses native image libraries that can of fer better performance.
— Caching: Built—in caching system is more robust and configurable.
— Modern image capabilities: Need for advanced features I ike content—aware resizing, blurhash placeholders,load ing.
— Transitions: When you need smooth transitions between image loading states.
— Cross—platform consistency: More consistent behavior across iOS and Android.
— Adaptivity: Better support for adaptive images based on screen size and resolution.

## Use React Native Image when:

— Simplicity: When you need basic image display with minimal configuration.
— Bundle size: When you' re trying to keep your app's bundle size smaller.
— No Expo dependency: When you' re not using Expo or want to minimize dependencies.
— Legacy support: When maintaining compatibility with existing code that uses React Native Image.
— Basic requirements: When advanced image features aren' t needed for your use case and progressive
